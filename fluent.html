        <h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
        <h4>Welcome to our journey creating a language vocabulary learning app!</h4>
        <p>A User Experience student exercise.</p>

        <h3>My Approach</h3>

        <h4>Empathize with the User</h4>
        <p>Research existing vocabulary learning apps and understand how users go about learning a new language.</p>

        <h4>Define the Problem</h4>
        <p>Develop a distinctive point-of-view that identify users needs, goals and behaviors. Then formulate clear problem and hypothesis statements.</p>

        <h4>Ideate Solutions</h4>
        <p>Explore solutions based on information gathered so far and define how users navigate the app to reach their solution(s).</p>

        <h4>Develop a Prototype</h4>
        <p>Sketch out rough ideas to visualize how the app will work, make adjustments, build wireframes and create an interactive prototype.</p>

        <h4>Test and Refine</h4>
        <p>Put my rough prototype to the test and make sure it is working to solve the problem. Ask “what can I make better?”</p>

        <h3>Empathize with the User</h3>
        <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
        <p>First, I evaluated three language vocabulary apps to determine what worked, what didn’t work and how Fluent could stand out and succeed in the marketplace.</p>

        <h4>Online Survey</h4>
        <p>Then I conducted an online survey to find out how people liked to learn new languages, what challenges they faced and what motivated them to continue learning.</p>
        <h5>Survey Questions</h5>
        <p>1. When was the last time you needed to learn new vocabulary for something? Were you successful? Why or why not?
          2. What is your favorite method for learning something new? (games, quizzes, flashcards, note taking, etc.)
          3. What makes learning new vocabulary fun? What keeps you motivated to continue learning?
          4. What makes learning new vocabulary challenging? How can it be made easier?
          5. Do you prefer studying by yourself or with others? Do you reach out to others for support? If so, who/what are those sources?
          6. What distracts or annoys you when using a learning app? How can it be improved?</p>

        <h4>User Persona</h4>
        <p>Based on survey responses, I created a persona to see through the user’s eyes while building the app.</p>
        <h4>Let's Meet Janar</h4>
        <p>He’s a college student in his 20’s. He recently moved to France and his is not fluent in French. He needs to expand his French vocabulary. His goal is to carry on a conversation in French and fit in sounding like a native speaker.</p>

          <img src="img/fluent/Fluent_Janar_persona@1200px.jpg" alt="My Image">
        </picture>
        <p>Janar needs a way to expand his vocabulary in a foreign language because he is new to the country and cannot communicate effectively or credibly with the people in their native tongue.</p>

        <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
        <p>Newcomers to a country need to expand their vocabulary in a foreign language because they cannot communicate effectively or credibly with the people in their native tongue.</p>

        <h4>Hypothesis Statement</h4>
        <p>We believe by creating an app that incorporates repetitive games with audio spoken by natives, we offer the highest rate of success to achieve our user’s goal of expanding his or her vocabulary in a foreign language and communicating
          credibly and effectively with the local people. We know this will be true when users converse seamlessly with native speakers in our app’s community and write favorable reviews on the Google Play and App Stores.</p>

        <h3>Ideate Solutions</h3>
        <h4>Task Flows</h4>
        <p>I created task flows Janar would take to illustrate pathways he would follow to accomplish his goals. They also served as an exercise to discover any problems that needed to be addressed and resolved.</p>

        <h3>Develop a Prototype</h3>
        <h4>Sketching</h4>
        <p>I sketched out series of screens to see how the app would work overall.</p>

        </picture>

        <h4>Low Fidelity Wireframes</h4>
        <p>I drew paper wireframes to visualize how the screens would look and interact with one another. Using these frames, I created a simple Prott prototype for testing.</p>

        </picture>

        <h3>Test and Refine</h3>
        <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
        <p>I then conducted five in-person usability tests to see what worked and what improvements were needed before putting it through development.</p>

        <h4>What was tested</h4>

        <p>1. Opening the app for the first time
          • to find out what the user will do instinctively
          • see what the user’s first impression is and how he/she feels about the app
          • determine if it is intuitive and/or easy to navigate

          2. Taking a vocabulary lesson
          • observe where the user initially goes to take a lesson
          • see how well the user answers/navigates through the lesson

          3. Taking a quiz
          • observe where the user initially goes to take a quiz
          • see how well the user answers/navigates through the questions

          4. Adding a vocabulary word to the library
          • receive feedback on the various ways to save a new word

          5. Talking to the virtual tutor
          • receive feedback on how the user interacts with the virtual tutor</p>

        <h3>What's next?</h3>

        <p>Janar wants to converse seamlessly in French and sound like a local. We believe that connecting Janar with native speakers, he can test his listening, comprehension and pronunciation skills. Those French speakers can act as tutors by
          sending him feedback and answer questions that come up in real conversation.
          We introduced the “Community” during the OnBoarding process and it currently appears along the bottom navigation. We need to determine how to incorporate this feature within the app. Should it have a larger presence on the Home Screen? Is
          it a part of the “Conversation” section as an option to send to a native speaker? Is the tutor the native speaker? Do you opt in as a native speaker for your own language in order to participate? How do you converse with the Community?
          The exploration continues...</p>
